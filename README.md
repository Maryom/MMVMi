MMVMi: A Validation Model for MVC and MVVM Design Patterns in iOS Applications

## Motivation
Design patterns have gained popularity as they provide strategies for solving specific problems. This repository is the source code of [my journal](http://www.iaeng.org/IJCS/issues_v45/issue_3/IJCS_45_3_03.pdf). The journal introduces a validation model that detects MVC problems, and helps programmers make the decision to switch between MVC and MVVM design pattern. The proposed validation model consists of two phases: phase one is to detect MVC problems, and phase two is to validate the relation between MVVM objects.
